            "abstract" : "We initiate the study of fair distribution of delivery tasks among a set of\nagents wherein delivery jobs are placed along the vertices of a graph. Our goal\nis to fairly distribute delivery costs (modeled as a submodular function) among\na fixed set of agents while satisfying some desirable notions of economic\nefficiency. We adopt well-established fairness concepts -- such as\nenvy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and minimax share (MMS) -- to our setting\nand show that fairness is often incompatible with the efficiency notion of\nsocial optimality. We then characterize instances that admit fair and socially\noptimal solutions by exploiting graph structures. We further show that\nachieving fairness along with Pareto optimality is computationally intractable.\nWe complement this by designing an XP algorithm (parameterized by the number of\nagents) for finding MMS and Pareto optimal solutions on every tree instance,\nand show that the same algorithm can be modified to find efficient solutions\nalong with EF1, when such solutions exist. The latter crucially relies on an\nintriguing result that in our setting EF1 and Pareto optimality jointly imply\nMMS. We conclude by theoretically and experimentally analyzing the price of\nfairness.",

            "abstract" : "Genome data are crucial in modern medicine, offering significant potential\nfor diagnosis and treatment. Thanks to technological advancements, many\nmillions of healthy and diseased genomes have already been sequenced; however,\nobtaining the most suitable data for a specific study, and specifically for\nvalidation studies, remains challenging with respect to scale and access.\nTherefore, in silico genomics sequence generators have been proposed as a\npossible solution. However, the current generators produce inferior data using\nmostly shallow (stochastic) connections, detected with limited computational\ncomplexity in the training data. This means they do not take the appropriate\nbiological relations and constraints, that originally caused the observed\nconnections, into consideration. To address this issue, we propose\ncancer-inspired genomics mapper model (CGMM), that combines genetic algorithm\n(GA) and deep learning (DL) methods to tackle this challenge. CGMM mimics\nprocesses that generate genetic variations and mutations to transform readily\navailable control genomes into genomes with the desired phenotypes. We\ndemonstrate that CGMM can generate synthetic genomes of selected phenotypes\nsuch as ancestry and cancer that are indistinguishable from real genomes of\nsuch phenotypes, based on unsupervised clustering. Our results show that CGMM\noutperforms four current state-of-the-art genomics generators on two different\ntasks, suggesting that CGMM will be suitable for a wide range of purposes in\ngenomic medicine, especially for much-needed validation studies.",

Existing low-light enhancement or deraining methods struggle to\nbrighten low-light conditions and remove rain simultaneously. Additionally,\ncascade approaches like ``deraining followed by low-light enhancement'' or the\nreverse often result in problematic rain patterns or overly blurred and\noverexposed images. To address these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end\nmodel called L$^{2}$RIRNet, designed to manage both low-light enhancement and\nderaining in real-world settings. Our model features two main components: a\nDual Degradation Representation Network (DDR-Net) and a Restoration Network.\nThe DDR-Net independently learns degradation representations for luminance\neffects in dark areas and rain patterns in light areas, employing dual\ndegradation loss to guide the training process. The Restoration Network\nrestores the degraded image using a Fourier Detail Guidance (FDG) module, which\nleverages near-rainless detailed images, focusing on texture details in\nfrequency and spatial domains to inform the restoration process. Furthermore,\nwe contribute a dataset containing both synthetic and real-world\nlow-light-rainy images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nL$^{2}$RIRNet performs favorably against existing methods in both synthetic and\ncomplex real-world scenarios.

            "title" : "Privacy in Speech Technology",
            "abstract" : "Speech technology for communication, accessing information and services has\nrapidly improved in quality. It is convenient and appealing because speech is\nthe primary mode of communication for humans. Such technology however also\npresents proven threats to privacy. Speech is a tool for communication and it\nwill thus inherently contain private information. Importantly, it however also\ncontains a wealth of side information, such as information related to health,\nemotions, affiliations, and relationships, all of which are private. Exposing\nsuch private information can lead to serious threats such as price gouging,\nharassment, extortion, and stalking. This paper is a tutorial on privacy issues\nrelated to speech technology, modeling their threats, approaches for protecting\nusers' privacy, measuring the performance of privacy-protecting methods,\nperception of privacy as well as societal and legal consequences. In addition\nto a tutorial overview, it also presents lines for further development where\nimprovements are most urgently needed.",

            "abstract" : "This is Part II of our paper in which we prove finite time blowup of the 2D\nBoussinesq and 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with smooth initial data of\nfinite energy and boundary. In Part I of our paper [ChenHou2023a], we establish\nan analytic framework to prove stability of an approximate self-similar blowup\nprofile by a combination of a weighted $L^\\infty$ norm and a weighted $C^{1/2}$\nnorm. Under the assumption that the stability constants, which depend on the\napproximate steady state, satisfy certain inequalities stated in our stability\nlemma, we prove stable nearly self-similar blowup of the 2D Boussinesq and 3D\nEuler equations with smooth initial data and boundary. In Part II of our paper,\nwe provide sharp stability estimates of the linearized operator by constructing\nspace-time solutions with rigorous error control. We also obtain sharp\nestimates of the velocity in the regular case using computer assistance. These\nresults enable us to verify that the stability constants obtained in Part I\n[ChenHou2023a] indeed satisfy the inequalities in our stability lemma. This\ncompletes the analysis of the finite time singularity of the axisymmetric Euler\nequations with smooth initial data and boundary.",
